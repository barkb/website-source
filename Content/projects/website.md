# Personal Website

The source code to this website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/barkb/personal-website) for anyone to check out. Big thanks to John Sundell for writing the Publish engine that powers this site! Maybe one day I'll get around to doing a write-up about how I wrote this site, but for now I'm focusing on other things. This website is still under active development, so check back from time to time to see what's changed.
