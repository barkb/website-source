# About Me

My name is Ben Barkett and I originally hail from Columbus, OH. I'm a Senior at Lake Forest College, starting to search for roles in the Computer Software Industry. I've spent most of 2020 learning Swift and iOS development, and I'm currently an iOS Development intern, looking for full time positions upon graduation. As a double major in Computer Science and Economics I'm a big-picture thinker who enjoys diving into the detail. When it comes to development, I just want to make good software. Having grown up with computers, I've always cared (maybe a little too much) about using software where I could tell the developer cared about getting the little things right. That's the kind of developer I want to strive to be. 

While I'm currently seeking employment opportunities, I hope to one day go into business for myself. I've always liked the idea of working for myself, and putting my time and energy into projects I find exciting. For now, however, I'm just starting out and I have a lot to learn before I can do everything by myself. 

Outside of coding, I'm an avid music fan, mechanical keyboard hobbyist, and die-hard Cleveland sports fan. I really enjoy cooking, especially for other people, and have not ruled out the possibility that I might start a restaurant some day.
