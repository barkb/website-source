Welcome to my website, my name is Ben. I'm currently a Senior in college at Lake Forest College, and I'm studying Computer Science and Economics. I built this site to serve as a landing page of sorts for me and what I'm working on. I'm an aspiring software developer who is particularly interested in Swift and iOS/macOS development. I wanted a place where I could showcase projects I'm working on or have worked on, and somewhere where I could write a little bit about what it's like getting a job in tech right out of college. Hopefully this site can serve as a resource to other CS students who are also looking for jobs, or who will be in the next few years. I know the world of CS Career and Interview prep can be a daunting place, especially for those like me who suffer from regular Imposter Syndrome. Personally, I am a little strung out on hearing about how I need to grind Leetcode for 8 hours a day to get a good job, so that's not what this blog is going to be about (no disrepect to Leetcode, they provide a great service). I hope for this to be a real and unfettered look into what the job search process is like so that others can learn from my mistakes. Beyond that, I wouldn't be surprised if I also write about various other hobbies or interests I have. I'm very into the mechanical keyboard community, and I'm a diehard Cleveland sports fan, so you can probably expect those to be talked about at some point, LOL! Please enjoy my website, and feel free to reach out to me directly using the Contact page.</p><p>Big thanks to John Sundell for writing the Publish engine that this site is built on.
